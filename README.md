Coffee Sales Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of coffee sales data using Excel. The goal is to track, analyze, and visualize coffee sales trends, helping businesses make data-driven decisions to optimize sales and improve performance.

This Excel-based project is designed to analyze and report on coffee sales over time. It includes tools to import sales data, perform calculations on sales performance, and visualize key metrics with charts and graphs. By using various Excel functions and features (such as PivotTables, formulas, and conditional formatting), this project provides insights into:

    Daily, weekly, or monthly sales trends
    Sales by region or sales representative
